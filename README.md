# Leonardo Mojoli

Medical student at Universidade Federal de Sergipe building software that bridges clinical medicine and AI.

No CS degree — just two years of obsessive dedication to solving real problems in healthcare with code.

## What I'm building

**[Quiron](https://quiron.app)** — AI-powered clinical intelligence platform for doctors and medical students. Built solo from scratch.
- 34K+ lines of Python backend (FastAPI, PostgreSQL, ChromaDB)
- Multi-model AI pipeline (Gemini 3 Flash for clinical reasoning, image analysis, RAG)
- 24 medical specialty SOAP templates, digital prescriptions, diagnostic support
- Gamified study arena with adaptive exams (ENAMED, USMLE, MIR)
- Virtual currency system (Dracma) with Stripe & Binance Pay
- Full i18n (PT-BR, EN, ES) — React 19 frontend with dark theme

**Latreo** *(in development)* — Backend API for a Multiple Sclerosis patient care app. AI-powered health agent that provides daily support, symptom tracking, and care management. Part of [Projeto EM App](https://github.com/Projeto-EM-App) at UFS.
